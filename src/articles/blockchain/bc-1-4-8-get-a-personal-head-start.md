# BC-1.4.8 Get a personal head start

Example six is me talking from a personal experience. I am personally and as a teacher: by getting acquainted with blockchain technology, you are actually at the forefront of innovation. It might not feel this way. It might feel like that we're already past a hype cycle and that everybody knows what blockchain is, 
and everybody knows what bitcoin is. But approximately only three to five percent of the world is "engaged" in these materials. And of that 3-5%, only a few percentages understand what this ledger technology encompasses. So if you want to get ahead of the crowd, if you're going to use it for your career, or if you're going to do a deep dive, want to learn more about this, because you're fascinated about technology  and in the possibilities: **THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO START.**


Do a deep dive here if you want to get a personal head start and be at the forefront! We will offer different rounds (levels). As mentioned, it's very multidisciplinary: you can go towards the IT direction, you can go towards the Economic direction, into the law direction, cybersecurity...pick the subjects, pick the topics!

Whatever you prefer :-)!

>ðŸ’¡  And remember: nobody voted about the internet, yet it is an essential part of your life. Blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, the monetary systems: decisions for you were made by others, others that understand these infrastructures of the 21st century and can spot the opportunities. So educate yourself and join them. 

Once more: if you have questions, comments, or remarks, please let us know in Discord. Because we strongly depend on your input, we want to learn more about this technology and all that it entices as well! We're currently experimenting/trying to upgrade the basic knowledge of blockchain technology. We can only do this with your help because our understanding is limited.

>ðŸ’¡  We, therefore, need your specialized insights, your opinion, your vision, and your way of seeing things! Let us know your thoughts via comments. 

Hopefully, see you in the Discord 
or in the comments of the YouTube clips.
