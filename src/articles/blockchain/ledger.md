An open public blockchain can be seen as a (1) "distributed", (2) "decentralized", (3) "ledger". In this section, we will explain what a ledger is. The other two components are for classes further up ahead.

Let's start with the very first lesson: what is a ledger?


>üí°  Ledgers play a vital role in societies. They are one of the backbones of current-day society. History has proven many times that when your ledger changes, new capabilities arise, and your community can change with it. With blockchain technology, we double this innovation fun:

(1) the form of the ledgers changes. From centralized and closed towards decentralized and open.

(2) the way we record transactions changes. From manual and compliance afterward towards automated registration with integrated compliance. Done via so-called smart contracts.


All way too techie for class 1 üòÑ Just remember: blockchains are an innovation of ledgers and enable new capabilities. Chances are that they will have a very substantial impact on society. And you are currently knocking on the front door of this new technology, clever you! An exciting time in human history, possibly one turning point towards new forms of (community-driven) societies. Societies where blockchains play the role of "trust tool", recording transactions in an improved fashion.


## The basics of a ledger: recording a transaction
Sorry students, let me get a hold of myself‚Ä¶. Let's start with the basics: you need to understand what a ledger is and grasp its concepts. So what is a ledger? A ledger is a tool we use to record transactions. But what are "transactions"? "Transactions" are nothing more than (economic) activities where people "exchange value". So "exchange" means that the value goes from "one person to the other person". Or instead of between people, between legal entities like foundations and corporations. Or even between machines nowadays!

üí° Different 'entities' can exchange value in a ledger.
‚ùì Can you think of other types of entities that can interact in a ledger?

And "value" can basically mean "anything, as long as we (humans) deem it valuable". Many books are written about 'value' over time, and many would love to enter the philosophical spheres about what value is. What might be valuable to you now but not be beneficial to somebody else. Or is value always measurable? The types of value we are talking about are metrics by nature. So you can measure them. This is needed to record them in a ledger. Try to record 'love üíò' in a ledger? And no: not talking about paid love. So value is often represented as something metric, usually monetary. Still, it could also represent values like a house which can be expressed in economic terms.

üí° value can take many forms. For example, in ledgers, we record measurable values. 
‚ùì What do you think has value? Can that value be recorded?
‚ùì Let your mind drift for a while: can you think of other values that have a hard time being measured? Are you sure they can not be measured, or do we need a new, improved ledger to measure them? Tip: thanks to blockchain technology, some of our planet's forests are recorded in ledgers nowadays!
‚ùì What is 'intrinsic value'? What has intrinsic value (if anything has‚Ä¶.)?

You can see a ledger as a tool for humans. Not one to build a house, but one to record the transfers of value. The device can take different forms and has done so over time, like a book or a digital database. It used to be a clay tablet 7,000 years ago. The core of the ledger remains the same: it records transactions. How fast, reliable, etc., changes over time. We are now entering a new era of ledgers, the blockchain era, with increased security, reach, transparency, reliability, and more. A new form of trust üí°.

**An example**  
If you don't fully grasp the concept, not to worry üòä! Let's rephrase the entire idea of a ledger. Then, let's use one of our most potent tools: our imagination!  Imagine an open book in front of you. You will use this book to record transactions. "Record" or "register" is nothing more than to write something down on the paper of your book. The digital variant would be entering something in a computer or a "database". Transactions are, like said, nothing more than the transfer of "value" from A to B, where "value" can be anything like money or a house.

So we now have this physical book (or digital database), where we record the transactions. But what kind of transactions? Close your eyes and imagine the following; just imagine that you are in a room with ten of your best friends. Your friends are just standing there, waiting for something to happen. You are stepping towards the sidelines of the room. You then drop a bag of $100 in the middle of the space to be equally divided between your 10 friends.

And that's where you & your ledger start to become active. Because you, from the sidelines, start recording stuff in your book. Where the book acts as a "ledger tool" in this case. You start with writing down (= recording) the names and identities of your friends in your book. Then, behind that name, you will record $10 per person. So you've got friend A, friend B, friend C, who all got $10. Congrats, you are now the proud owner of a ledger that contains the account balance for each of your friends (10$ per friend, $100 in total).

üí° This overview of 'who owns what, when in time' is also known as the 'state of the ledger'. A good ledger mimics the world as best as possible.

With each transaction, the state of the ledger changes. A trade would be; 

* Friend B: "can you scratch my back? I have an itch there."
* Friend D: "Yeah, sure. But it will cost you $1."
* Friend B: "I will give you a dollar if you scratch my back."

The transfer of this 1$ from friend B to friend D needs to be recorded. Not only does the dollar physically transfer, from hand to hand, where your friend D now has $11, and your friend B has $9. It also needs to be recorded in your ledger. You are on the sidelines, witnessing the transaction, so you register $ -1 at friend B en $+1 for friend D. So the ledger, in this case, is the tool that you use to record the transfer of value. You mimic the world, the world of physical cash in this case, as best as possible. We will explain later why you want to keep track of those transactions / why this is important! So far, you should understand that a ledger is a tool we use to record transactions, a.k.a. value exchanges.

## Assets
Value in the previous example was in dollars, but it can be many things, also commonly known as "assets". There are two main categories of assets: (1) tangible assets & (2) intangible assets. Assets can also be divided into current assets & fixed/long-term assets. Tangible assets are physical things you can touch, and intangible assets are things you can't feel. Examples of tangible assets are cash money, such as a banknote, a car, or a house. Examples of intangible assets are the money on your bank account, which is only available in the digital ledgers of banks, or copyrights. It is important to note that intangible, a.k.a. untouchable assets, only exist because of ledgers. Most of our current records hold intangible assets, like our money or stocks. You would have no way to check the record-state with a real-life physical supply as was possible in the previous example with your friends. Intangible assets are not there in the "real" physical world and only exist according to the registers. 
üí° They are imaginary, a 'story' we humans tell each other. And that is why it is essential to keep a record of transactions. It is a record of the story and the current 'state' of who owns what. With each transaction this story, this state of the ledger changes.

‚ùì Challenge yourself before the next class: what makes a ledger important?

## Conclusion
Ledgers are tools to record economic activities, known as transactions, which transfer value. These tools, these ledgers, can take many different forms and evolve from clay tablets to digital blockchains in 7,000 years. As ledgers develop, communities/society tends to involve as well because new options are introduced. Just as we use regular books to record our stories, like Cinderella, we use ledgers to record our stories of value exchanges. New ways of recording have enabled us to tell better stories. This goes for regular stories. Just try to write Game of Thrones on a clay tablet if you don't believe me. But also for stories of value exchange. Just try to set up the current world economy without digital ledgers).

In the next class, we will explain WHY ledgers have an essential role.
